Bitruncated 24-cell
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_24-cells#Bitruncated_24-cell
48 cells; 48 1C: R0, never move
336 faces: 
 - 144 octagons; 144 2C octagonal pieces, R1
 - 192 triangles; 192 2C triangular pieces, R1
576 edges; 576 3C, R2. Faces around an edge: 8-8-3
288 vertices; 288 4C, R3

each cell has 14 faces, 36 edges, and 24 vertices. Really comparable to 120-cell.
25 nontrivial pieces per cell: 1200 pieces in total

Sticker count: Each cell has: 
1 cell sticker
6 octagonal sticker
8 triangular sticker
36 edges
24 vertices


Octagonal 2C: 8 pieces in each orbit. 144/8 = 18 orbits. Moving each cell changes parity of 3 orbits.
18 orbits divided into 3 groups (at least two ways to divide). Each group has 6 orbits: a straight line through a central cell + 4 helices around it + length-8 cycle perpendicular to the straight line
Each orbit chains 8 cells. In each group, the 6 orbits chains all 48 cells. Each group is one way to partition 48 cells.
Parity of a group = sum of parity of the 6 orbits in it.
Since moving each cell changes one orbit in each group, the parity of all 3 groups are the same.

Triangular 2C: 6 pieces in each orbit. 192/6 = 32 orbits. Moving each cell changes parity of 4 orbits.
4 groups? each with 8 orbits?
A straight line through a central cell in a diagonal way + length-6 chain perpendicular to the line + 6 helices?

2C pieces should not have orientation.
---------

3C: 24 pieces in each orbit. 24 orbits
The equator plane perpendicular to the center cell: 6 cells distance 2 to the center + 12 edge cells. 4 pieces on each of the 6 cells = 24.
The pieces are like the vertices of a Rhombicuboctahedron. Turning a cell <=> rotating a square on rhombicuboctahedron by 180.
On each cell there are 36 edges. They belong to 9 orbits, 4 pieces in each orbit. Since each turn swaps 2 pairs in each orbit, the permutation in each orbit is always even.
The 3C pieces cannot be rotated (a->b->c->a) in place. I don't see any way to mirror a 3C piece. As far as I find, orientation of 3C is automatically solved.

-------------
4C: seems to be in 1 orbit. 

A piece can be flipped (a<->b, c, d unchanged). But known sequences are too long.

----------
Plan: start from parity of 2C.
